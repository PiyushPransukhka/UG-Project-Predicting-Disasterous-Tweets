## UG Project Predicting Disastrous Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. So, we are challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data).
